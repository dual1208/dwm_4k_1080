# 2. Check for the correct number of arguments.

# 3. Verify the input file exists and is readable.

# --- Main Logic ---

# Create a secure, temporary directory to work in. This prevents clutter
# and avoids overwriting existing files until the very end.
local temp_dir
temp_dir=$(mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/split_sh.XXXXXX")

# The 'trap' command is a safeguard. It ensures that no matter how the script
# exits (normally, with an error, or via interruption), the temporary
# directory will be automatically and safely removed.
trap 'rm -rf "$temp_dir"' EXIT INT TERM

$VERBOSE && echo "Created temporary directory at '$temp_dir'"

# Use csplit to break the file into pieces.
#  -s : Runs in silent mode.
#  -k : Keeps the generated files even if an error occurs.
#  -z : Elides (removes) empty output files. This is crucial to avoid creating
#       an empty file from the content before the very first '##' delimiter.
#  -f : Specifies the prefix for the output files.
# The pattern '/^## /' tells csplit where to split.
# '{*}' repeats the split for every occurrence of the pattern.
if ! csplit -skz -f "$temp_dir/part_" "$input_file" '/^## /' '{*}'; then
    echo "Error: csplit failed to split the file. Aborting." >&2
    exit 1 # The trap will handle cleanup
fi

$VERBOSE && echo "Successfully split file into temporary parts."

  # Sanitize the title to create a safe and valid filename.
  # 1. Remove the leading '## ' and any extra whitespace.
  # 2. Replace troublesome characters (spaces, slashes) with a hyphen.
  # 3. Remove any character that is not alphanumeric, a hyphen, or a dot.
  # 4. Append the '.md' file extension.

  # directory with its new, meaningful name.
